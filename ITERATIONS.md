# Counter vision iterations

Acceptance criteria are fixed by AGENT_BRIEF. Synthetic tests do not establish live accuracy.

| Iteration | Hypothesis / change | Before | After | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Reproducible Python 3.12 and environment-only credentials | Python 3.14, author keys embedded | Python 3.12.15; credentials excluded from source and git | Keep. API authentication still returns 401; no image transmitted. |
| 1 | A privacy-first recorder and uniform adapters make later comparisons reproducible | Single-screen anecdotal tests | Pending controlled tests; no holdout dataset yet | Infrastructure only; no model promotion. |
